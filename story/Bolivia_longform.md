For my first trip to South America, I'm off to Bolivia with Andrés and a group of friends. We'll attend Marianna's wedding, and travel in the country for a couple of weeks.

## Part 1 - Landing in Bolivia 

### Day 1 (Dec. 28th): 11,400km 

I wake up at 3 A.M., for a 28-hour-long trip that will take me from the south of France to La Paz (Bolivia), through Madrid (Spain) and Lima (Peru).  
In Madrid, I meet up with my friends Damien, Justine, Hélène and Ross. Andrés, who was already spending Christmas with his family in La Paz, is waiting for us at the airport with a taxi-van. Our travel crew is finally complete!  

Our first apartment hotel, [Bolivian Suites](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g294072-d7346545-Reviews-Bolivian_Suites-La_Paz_La_Paz_Department.html), is a short drive down from El Alto airport, which is 4000m above sea level. 

I mention altitude because a fairly common problem where traveling to very high altitude (3500m above sea level or higher) is mountain sickness.  

[Altitude sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness), or mountain sickness, presents as "non-specific symptoms", generally resembling a case of "flu, carbon monoxide poisoning, or a hangover" (headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc.)  
It's hard to tell how much someone will be affected by altitude sickness: regardless of fitness and health status, it can affect anyone with various levels of intensity. 
It generally lasts for a couple of days at most, while the body acclimates to its new environment. In the most severe cases, it can cause pulmonary or cerebral edema.  

The condition is due to the body absorbing less oxygen than it is used to at high altitude, as explained by this formula:

> Pressure of inspired oxygen = fraction of oxygen in air (21% -- this does not change until 21000m above sea level) × atmospheric pressure (this decreases with altitude)

As altitude increases, pressure decreases and the amount of oxygen absorbed is lower than what the body is used to, which in turn causes the symptoms described above.

The best way to prevent it is to acclimate to altitude slowly, which can take days or weeks depending on the altitude of the destination. When that's not possible, like in our case (we went from 0 to 4000m above sea level in one day), a medication called Diamox works well preventatively but also to treat the symptoms themselves.  
Most of of the people in our group are playing it safe: we're taking it 24h before landing in La Paz. The only symptoms we're feeling are mild headaches and fatigue, which to be fair could be caused by our long trip!

### Day 2 (Dec. 29th): Getting used to the altitude 

Happy birthday, Ross!  
We're taking it easy today as our bodies acclimatise to the altitude. We've checked in to [the nice hotel](https://casa-grande.com.bo) we chose to rest up before the wedding tomorrow.  
We're also following the advice from Andres' family: don't make any physical effort (we're not even leaving the hotel), and don't drink alcohol in your first few days at high altitude!  

Too bad for Ross, who wanted to celebrate his birthday with some cocktails on the rooftop bar in the hotel... 

### Day 3 (Dec. 30th): Wedding day!

It's day #2 of taking it easy. We chill at the swimming pool and jacuzzi at the hotel, before heading out to [Paroquia del Monticulo](https://goo.gl/maps/DgN9PMcDF6w), the church where Mariana and Alejandro's wedding is taking place. 

The wedding is what you'd expect from a Christian wedding ceremony, in terms of texts and ritual. But it is also a beautiful, disorganised show of love and unity from the family and friends of the couple. In South America, both the nuclear and extended families feels much closer and tight-knit than in Europe.
After the ceremony, we congratulate the newly-wed couple and their families, and head back to the hotel using [Mi Teleférico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_Telef%C3%A9rico).  

![La Paz, as seen from Paroquia del Monticulo](http://imgur.com/1rCWw3k.jpg)

Mi Teleférico is La Paz' cable car system. Running since 2014, it consists of four lines spreading over roughly 15km. On top of being a very efficient way of traveling across the city, the transport system offers a great view of the capital and the surrounding mountains. 

Finally, we head off to the beautiful place Marianna and Alej chose to celebrate their wedding with friends: we enjoy a nice dinner, good company, and have a good time on the dance floor. I'm a bit tired and I have a slight headache, so I stay away from booze (especially since it's mostly rhum and whiskey, and I like neither!)

### Day 4 (Dec. 31th): ¡Feliz año!

Today, we head out with Andres' cousin Claudia, her boyfriend Youssef and the rest of our crew to Valle de la Luna. It's a beautiful natural park with very original rock formations. 

![Valle de la Luna - Rock formations](http://imgur.com/nqI3nQ2.jpg)

![Valle de la Luna - Landscape](http://imgur.com/r9z8E31.jpg)

We spend New Year's Eve with Andres' extended family, in his grand-parents house, where we are fed picana (a Bolivian soup with various meats and vegetables) and paella. The highlights of the evening include people running up and down the stairs with suitcases (see below), and lighting a bunch of fireworks in the garden, which everyone seems to be doing tonight in Bolivia! 

Bolivia has its own set of traditions for New Year's Eve, which all kick off at midnight:
 - Bolivia shares the [Twleve Grapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Grapes) custom with Spain: at midnight, at each strike of the bell, one should eat a grape, and make a wish!  
 - Another Bolivian tradition is to wear red underwear that night if you wish to be lucky in love that year. Yellow underwear is for money, green for health, pink for friendship, etc. On the 31st of December, you'll see a lot of street vendors selling underwear, of all sizes and all colours!
 - For a year full of travels, the custom is to take your suitcases to the door, and carry them up and down flights of stairs.  
 - Finally, if you want to become rich, you should count some money at midnight. Street vendors will actually sell wads of fake bills that you can count after the stroke of midnight.

### Day 4 (Jan. 1st 2017): Stomach problems

Even though we have been super careful with our food & drinks, most people in our crew aren't feeling well today. Damien, Justine and Ross are feeling especially bad.  

We call Andres' dad, Guillermo, to the rescue: he's a gastro-enterologist. He sees everyone, gives us some advice on what to eat and what to avoid, and gives some of us the medication we need to travel the next day.  

From this point forward, we are used to asking each other how we are feeling every day, and talking about poop becomes normal.  

We rest most of the day, and pack our bags for the 8-day tour that starts the next day... We'll be back in La Paz mid-way through the tour, so we leave what we won't need with Andrés' family. 

## Part 2 - Sucre & Potosí

### Day 5 (Jan. 2nd): Sucre

Today, 7AM start to get on a flight for Sucre. Everyone is feeling a bit better except for Damien who was sick all night. The trip is a bit rough on him, but we all make it to Sucre's airport, where our guide and driver are waiting for us.

We check-in at the hotel, where we leave Damien to rest for the afternoon. We head off for our quick tour of the city with the guide. We're a bit disappointed as today is a bank holiday here in Bolivia, so a lot of the places and museums we were supposed to visit as part of the tour are closed today.

Sucre is the constitutional capital of Bolivia. It was the capital when Bolivia declared independence in 1825.  
However, after a short civil war in 1898, the administrative and legislative branches of the Bolivian government were moved to La Paz, which is now Bolivia's *de facto* capital, while Sucre retains the judicial power.  
The rivalry between the two city has stayed alive all these years. In fact, in 2007, the Constituent Assembly, a group set up by Bolviia's president Evo Morales to re-write Bolivia's constitution, was considering moving the executive seat of the government back to Sucre. This triggered protests both in La Paz and Sucre.  
The new Constitution of Bolivia came into effect in 2009 after being approved in a referendum. It re-acknoledged Sucre as Bolivia's official capital, but also confirmed that the institutions will remain where they are (executive and legislative in La Paz, judiciary in Sucre).  

We visit the Plaza Pedro de Anzúrez, which oversees the city; the Cementerio General, a beautiful cemetery in the heart of the city, and the final resting place for many famous figures, including ex-presidents; and we walk through Parque Bolivar, a sunny, happy park named after Bolivia's first president, Simón Bolívar.

We also stop by the city's market, which is full of brightly coloured fruits and vegetables, in stalls manned by sleepy [cholitas](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26172313). 

![Bright fruits at the market](http://imgur.com/x1DfO4R.jpg)

![Cholita durmiendo](http://imgur.com/xv3EAxL.jpg)

Late in the afternoon, Andrés teaches everyone a Bolivian card game he plays a lot with his grand-parents, similar to the game Rummi. Ross, Hélène and I watch the newest episode of Sherlock -- we love it!  

We all head out for dinner and play more card games before calling it a night! 

### Day 6 (Jan. 3rd): Potosí

Our driver picks us up to take us to the city of Potosí. There, we meet our guide and driver for the day. 

We visit the *Casa Nacional de Moneda* (National Mint of Bolivia) and visit the city with our guide.  

Potosí has a fascinating history: it went from being the economic capital of the world because of its rich silver mines to very poor, and suffered a lot in the hands of the douanier string colonial times. In those times, the coins made in Potosí were used in Bolivia, Spain, and the whole world. Ironically, Bolivia is now relying on Canada and France to make its coins and bills! 

![Potosí](http://imgur.com/pm4Tnnc.jpg)

Even though this wasn't originally part of our plan, we insist on visiting of the mines, which adds about 4 hours to our already busy day. It's worth it in the end: we gear up with protective hats and clothes, buy gifts to leave for the miners, and follow our guide deep in the mine.  
It turns out our guide worked in the mine from the age of 12. He tells us about the life of the miners, and their beliefs in Mother Earth (*Pacha Mama*) and the Devil (*el tío*). 

Before leaving, we make one last quick stop at the Cathedral which oversees the whole city.  

![View for the Cathedral in Potosí](http://imgur.com/gqUMZp1.jpg)  

Our next stop is Uyuni. It's a long drive (4 hours), but the scenery is amazing. When we get there, we thank our guide and leave him a generous tip: he's by far the best guide we've had so far.  

## Part 3 - El Salar & South Bolivia

### Day 7 (Jan. 4th): Uyuni & Salar

Our driver for the next 4 days picks us up from the hostal un Uyuni. He doesn't speak much. To be fair, these types of tours are usually for 5 people, plus a driver and guide. But we had to give up on the guide, as there are already 6 of us!

Our first stop is the Train Graveyard. As one of the main cities in southwest Bolivia, Uyuni is and has always been an important transport hub. In the past, Uyuni was also an important distribution hub, for carrying the various minerals which Bolivia is rich of (such as gold, lead, silver) to the ports on the Pacific coast. The Train Graveyard is the result of a failed rail construction project from the 1890s.

After a quick stop at the very touristy market to buy some souvenirs, we head in the *Salar*.  
This salt flat, which spreads across 11,000km^2, is the result of a prehistoric lake going dry.  
Despite being a very popular tourist attraction, the desert is so big that it feels as if we are alone, in the middle of nowhere.

![Our little group at El Salar](http://imgur.com/YdG4Ep4.jpg)

We stop to have lunch at *Isla Incahuasi*. This time, we have to overcome our fear of "unsafe food": the guide cooked and brought lunch for us, and it's the only food we're going to get until tonight.  
*Isla incahuasi* is a strange, rock island in the middle of the desert, covered in cacti. It is also the only bit of relief in the otherwise very flat Salar: we hike up and down the island to enjoy the view from the higher ground.

![Isla Incahuasi and the Salar](http://imgur.com/Zz97dcX.jpg)
![More interesting things to do!](http://imgur.com/XxknYFn.jpg)

After stopping at various points of interest in the Salar in the afternoon, we head to the very special hotel we chose for that night: the Palacio de Sal hotel. The walls, roofs and most of the furniture of the hotel was built using salt from the Salar.

### Day 8 (Jan. 5th): Desertios & Lagunas

A bit of a rough start!  
No one in the group sleeps well that night: there was a big storm in the middle of the night, and the temperature went from very warm to very cold overnight.  
We check out at 7:30AM. Because of the storm, the internet and part of the power grid went down, which means that we cannot pay the hotel by card like we had planned. They are not happy about it, but we need to go, and in the end they have to agree that we'll find a way to pay them later.  

It has rained quite a bit during the night, so the road is muddy, and our driver has to drive carefully. 

Even though we spend most of the day in the car, we see beautiful scenery on the way. We stop by the *Valle de rocas* (Valley of Rocks), and a few lakes (*Laguna Evianda*, *Laguna Charcon*), home to hundreds of flamingos.

![Valle de rocas](http://imgur.com/BwVPJ2u.jpg)

We finally reach *Tayka del Desierto*, our accomodation for the night. At 4700m above sea level, this  eco-lodge, powered by solar power, redistributes all profits back to the community.  

Once again, we are are miles away from any city, and it shows: the landscape around us is breathtaking. The colours are incredible: tuft of bright orange grass sprout up all over the dark red ground, and the luminous light grey skies make the distant mountains pop out even more. 

![View from the dining room at Tayka del Desierto](http://imgur.com/sJExToo.jpg)

Despite the headache caused by the altitude, this is my favourite part of the trip. We enjoy a delicious dinner, surrounded by this almost Mars-like view... 

### Day 9 (Jan. 6th): Natural reserve

The plan for today is, basically, a lot of driving: we're driving South, to see the beautiful landscapes from the Eduardo Avaroa National Reserve, then North, back to Uyuni, where we'll be flying back to La Paz in the evening. 

My headache from yesterday is still very much alive, so the 4AM start time is extra painful. It's still night outside.  
Our driver gets lost trying to find out first stop, el árbol de piedra. He doesn't have a map or GPS. When one of us manages to pull up a map of our current position on his smartphone, we think we're saved. But it turns out our driver doesn't know how to read a map: he's used to navigating using the landmarks around him. Unfortunately, it is still dark and he doesn't recognise the mountains around us... We are lucky enough to cross paths with another car, so we ask them for directions. Soon after, the sun rises and we understand why our driver was confused: the dark shapes around us were not mountains but thick clouds, slowly floating around us. 

*El arbol de piedra* is as beautiful as advertised, and it is another one of my favourite sights from the trip. The tree-shaped stone, part of an isolated rock formation in the middle of the Siloli desert, was created by the strong winds blowing there: the sand they are carrying is slowly eroding the stone and giving it this original shape. 

![El arbol de piedra](http://imgur.com/M1SbeUw.jpg)

We keep driving South, stopping to enjoy the sights of *Laguna Colorada* (the *Coloured Lake*), the Geysers of Sol de Mañana (just short of 5000km above sea level), all the way to the *Lagune Verde* and *Laguna Blanca* (the *Green* and *White Lakes*), right at the border between Bolivia and Chile. From there, you can also see Argentina, which is only 40 kilometers away. 

The return drive to Uyuni is more stressful: despite our driver telling us "not to worry" a few times today, it looks like we will barely make it back to Uyuni in time for our flight back to La Paz.  

Unfortunately, it turns out that the only road leading back to Uyuni from where we are is closed because of the Dakar Rally. We are stuck at a police roadblock alongside dozens of cars and buses full of tourists, with no other choice but to watch the Dakar trucks drive by. 

Despite our flight being delayed, we end up missing it by just a few minutes. This is really inconvenient, because we have a fairly expensive hotel booked for tonight in La Paz, a bus booked tomorrow at 6AM, a hotel near Lake Titicaca for tomorrow evening, etc.  

Luckily for me and the rest of the group, Andrés spends a lot of energy sorting things out with our travel agency, who hadn't warned us about the race, and our hotel in La Paz. 
We sleep in a hostel in Uyuni instead, after having booked our replacement flight to La Paz for 9:30AM the next day.

## Part 4 - Lake Titicaca 

### Day 10 (Jan. 7th): Copacabana

This time, we make it onto our 9:30AM flight to La Paz! A driver from the travel agency is waiting for us and drives us to Copacabana, a touristic city on lake Titicaca. 

In the city, we meet the owners of a small restaurant, *Pan America's Picnic Basket*. Deb and Jeff, a lovely American couple from Chicago, originally came to Bolivia doing volunteer work for a few months. But they soon fell in love with the place, and opened their pizzeria there. Jeff gives us some advice on what to do next in the city, and tell us about how happy he and Deb in Copacabana:
> "It's the land of the dreams, just like the US is supposed to be. In the US it would be really hard to open a restaurant, because of the upfront money we'd need, and all the regulations. Here it was easy."

Following Jeff's advice, we visit of the city's basilica, Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana. It is well-know for housing the statue of the *Virgen de Copacabana*, patron saint of Bolivia. 

Lake Titicaca and some of its islands hold a particular importance in the Inca mythology from the Andes region of South America. The local indigenous people believed in a creator divinity called Viracocha, who traveled to lake Titicaca. On *Isla del Sol*, he created Sun god Inti; and Moon godess Mama Quilla was born on *Isla de la Luna*. Both islands are still seen as sacred by some of the locals.
Viracocha also birthed *Pachamama* (Mother Earth), godess of fertility, often represented as a mountain.  

Mid-16th century, after the colonisation of Bolivia, the Catholic started converting the natives to Christianity. In the following years, many symbols from the Inca mythology "blended" with the Christian symbols: the Virgin Mary merged with Pachamama, her dress taking the shape of a mountain. The Sun and Moon deities also appear in a lot of paintings of Virgin Mary, sometimes as characters in the scene depicted, other times, simply under the form of the Sun shining behind Mary's head and the Moon under her feet. 
This is true of  the *Virgen de Copacabana*, which wears a wide, mountain-shaped dress, has a sun-decorated mirror behind her heard, and a moon under her feet. Another great example of this is the famous painting *Virgen de Cerro Rico*, which we saw back in Potosi.

### Day 11 (Jan. 8th): Isla del Sol

This monring, we take the ferry to **Isla del Sol**.
Instead of the donkeys that were supposed to help carry our luggage on arrival, we find a group of locals, including a few small women, who don't look like they will be able to help us much. Look are deceiving though, and we realise quickly that, even burdened with our bags, they are climbing up the hill much faster than us...  It takes us more than 30min to reach the Posada del Inca Eco-Lodge where we will staying tonight. 

We spend our day hiking all the way across the island. We have missed the last ferry back to the South end, so we end up hiring a private boat to take us back. We make it back to the lodge just in time for dinner (quinoa soup and freshly caught trout with rice), where we celebrate our friend Helene's birthday. 
The best gift of all isn't one we bought her: for the first time in days, we don't have to be up early tomorrow! 

## Part 5 - Chilling in La Paz

### Day 12 (Jan. 9th): Back to La Paz

Julio, the van driver who first drove us from the airport to La Paz when we landed in Bolivia almost 2 weeks ago, is back! He drives us back to La Paz. It is the end of the "adventurous" part of the trip, and we are glad to check back in to Casa Grande hotel for our last few days in Bolivia.

We have a chilled evening at the hotel's rooftop bar, where Andres' siblings Dani, Maya and Bernie join us with some friends & cousins.
This is where I discover Singani, the national spirit from Bolivia. The liquor, distlled from grapes and similar to Pisco, is said to get it's unique taste from the elevation. If you're visiting La Paz, you've got to try a *Singani Sour*!

### Day 13 (Jan. 10th): Souvenir shopping & a fine restaurant experience

We try to make the most out of our last few days in La Paz: 
we visit the *Basílica de San Francisco*, buy a few souvenirs at the Mercado de las brujas (*the witches' market*), and we check out *Plaza Murillo*, where Evo Morales's controversial (?) palace is still mid-construction. 

In the evening, we have dinner at a restaurant called Gustu. We call ahead to let the staff know we'll try the tasting menu, which consists of 6 "snacks", followed by 7 tasting courses, each served with a matching drink. 

[Gustu is ...]

We can't believe our luck when we realise our table is in the kitchen. It's there that, talking about our favourites parts of the trip, savouring the great food that the chefs are cooking around us, I really feel that our trip is coming to an end. 

Over the course of the meal, I have some of the best food I've had in my life, and discover a few new things (alligator ceviche, for example.) The evening ends with a tour of the restaurant and kitchens. By the time we finish our discussion with our lovely waiter, all the other customers have left the restaurant. 

This is, to this date, the best gastronomical experience I've had in my life, for a very reasonable price. If you ever visit La Paz, I would recommend you go and experience it yourself!

### Day 14 (Jan. 11th): Last day in La Paz

After enjoying a late breakfast and a visit to the hotel's jacuzzi, we check out and do a bit of shopping. South America is known for its baby Alpaga fabric, one of the softest fabrics in the world. 

We buy some clothes, and some chocolate and flowers for Andres' family who are invite us for dinner and to stay over for our last night in La Paz.

But before that, we take the Mi Teleferico all the way up to El Alto, where we can see all of La Paz. Funnily, the best view of the city from the top of the téléphérique is from Bolivia's own version of KFC called Pollos Copacabana. 

Having enjoyed a great view of the city from high up in the téléphérique, we head back to Andres' grand-parents' house where we are fed a really good Bolivian dish, *Pique (A Lo) Macho*. It was so nice of them to welcome us and share their home with us! 

We give our thanks, say our goodbyes, pack our bags and set our alarms for 3:45AM.

## Miami

### Day 15 (Jan. 12th): Goodbye Bolivia

4AM start. Julio, the driver, picks us up from the Aguilar residence. We stop by Casa Grande to pick up Helene and Ross who stated there last night, and drive to the airport.

We all fly to Miami, with a stopover in Santa Cruz. There, in our very last stop in Bolivia, we can finally have salteñas for breakfast: they are a delicious type of chicken empanadas that are only served for breakfast. 

In Miami, we split up: while Ross and the girls and heading back to London, Damien, Andrés and I will spend 2 days in Miami before heading back to real life!
