		<h1>Travel Diaries: Bolivia</h1>
		For my first trip to South America, I'm off to Bolivia with Andrés and a group of friends. We'll attend Marianna's wedding, and travel in the country for a couple of weeks.

		<h2><a id="Part_1__Landing_in_Bolivia_2"></a>Part 1 - Landing in Bolivia</h2>
		<h3><a id="Day_1_Dec_28th_11400km_4"></a>Day 1 (Dec. 28th): 11,400km</h3>
		<p>I wake up at 3 A.M., for a 28-hour-long trip that will take me from the south of France to La Paz (Bolivia), through Madrid (Spain) and Lima (Peru).<br>
		In Madrid, I meet up with my friends Damien, Justine, Hélène and Ross. Andrés, who was already spending Christmas with his family in La Paz, is waiting for us at the airport with a taxi-van. Our travel crew is finally complete!</p>
		<p>Our first apartment hotel, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g294072-d7346545-Reviews-Bolivian_Suites-La_Paz_La_Paz_Department.html">Bolivian Suites</a>, is a short drive down from El Alto airport, which is 4000m above sea level.</p>
		<p>I mention altitude because a fairly common problem where traveling to very high altitude (3500m above sea level or higher) is mountain sickness.</p>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness">Altitude sickness</a>, or mountain sickness, presents as “non-specific symptoms”, generally resembling a case of “flu, carbon monoxide poisoning, or a hangover” (headaches, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc.)<br>
		It’s hard to tell how much someone will be affected by altitude sickness: regardless of fitness and health status, it can affect anyone with various levels of intensity.<br>
		It generally lasts for a couple of days at most, while the body acclimates to its new environment. In the most severe cases, it can cause pulmonary or cerebral edema.</p>
		<p>The condition is due to the body absorbing less oxygen than it is used to at high altitude, as explained by this formula:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Pressure of inspired oxygen = fraction of oxygen in air (21% – this does not change until 21000m above sea level) × atmospheric pressure (this decreases with altitude)</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>As altitude increases, pressure decreases and the amount of oxygen absorbed is lower than what the body is used to, which in turn causes the symptoms described above.</p>
		<p>The best way to prevent it is to acclimate to altitude slowly, which can take days or weeks depending on the altitude of the destination. When that’s not possible, like in our case (we went from 0 to 4000m above sea level in one day), a medication called Diamox works well preventatively but also to treat the symptoms themselves.<br>
		Most of of the people in our group are playing it safe: we’re taking it 24h before landing in La Paz. The only symptoms we’re feeling are mild headaches and fatigue, which to be fair could be caused by our long trip!</p>
		<h3><a id="Day_2_Dec_29th_Getting_used_to_the_altitude_26"></a>Day 2 (Dec. 29th): Getting used to the altitude</h3>
		<p>Happy birthday, Ross!<br>
		We’re taking it easy today as our bodies acclimatise to the altitude. We’ve checked in to <a href="https://casa-grande.com.bo">the nice hotel</a> we chose to rest up before the wedding tomorrow.<br>
		We’re also following the advice from Andres’ family: don’t make any physical effort (we’re not even leaving the hotel), and don’t drink alcohol in your first few days at high altitude!</p>
		<p>Too bad for Ross, who wanted to celebrate his birthday with some cocktails on the rooftop bar in the hotel…</p>
		<h3><a id="Day_3_Dec_30th_Wedding_day_34"></a>Day 3 (Dec. 30th): Wedding day!</h3>
		<p>It’s day #2 of taking it easy. We chill at the swimming pool and jacuzzi at the hotel, before heading out to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DgN9PMcDF6w">Paroquia del Monticulo</a>, the church where Mariana and Alejandro’s wedding is taking place.</p>
		<p>The wedding is what you’d expect from a Christian wedding ceremony, in terms of texts and ritual. But it is also a beautiful, disorganised show of love and unity from the family and friends of the couple. In South America, both the nuclear and extended families feels much closer and tight-knit than in Europe.<br>
		After the ceremony, we congratulate the newly-wed couple and their families, and head back to the hotel using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_Telef%C3%A9rico">Mi Teleférico</a>.</p>

		</div>

		<p>Mi Teleférico is La Paz’ cable car system. Running since 2014, it consists of four lines spreading over roughly 15km. On top of being a very efficient way of traveling across the city, the transport system offers a great view of the capital and the surrounding mountains.</p>
		<p>Finally, we head off to the beautiful place Marianna and Alej chose to celebrate their wedding with friends: we enjoy a nice dinner, good company, and have a good time on the dance floor. I’m a bit tired and I have a slight headache, so I stay away from booze (especially since it’s mostly rhum and whiskey, and I like neither!)</p>
		<h3><a id="Day_4_Dec_31th_Feliz_ao_47"></a>Day 4 (Dec. 31th): ¡Feliz año!</h3>
		<p>Today, we head out with Andres’ cousin Claudia, her boyfriend Youssef and the rest of our crew to Valle de la Luna. It’s a beautiful natural park with very original rock formations.</p>

		</div>

		<p>We spend New Year’s Eve with Andres’ extended family, in his grand-parents house, where we are fed picana (a Bolivian soup with various meats and vegetables) and paella. The highlights of the evening include people running up and down the stairs with suitcases (see below), and lighting a bunch of fireworks in the garden, which everyone seems to be doing tonight in Bolivia!</p>
		<p>Bolivia has its own set of traditions for New Year’s Eve, which all kick off at midnight:</p>
		<p><ul>
		<li>Bolivia shares the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Grapes">Twleve Grapes</a> custom with Spain: at midnight, at each strike of the bell, one should eat a grape, and make a wish!</li>
		<li>Another Bolivian tradition is to wear red underwear that night if you wish to be lucky in love that year. Yellow underwear is for money, green for health, pink for friendship, etc. On the 31st of December, you’ll see a lot of street vendors selling underwear, of all sizes and all colours!</li>
		<li>For a year full of travels, the custom is to take your suitcases to the door, and carry them up and down flights of stairs.</li>
		<li>Finally, if you want to become rich, you should count some money at midnight. Street vendors will actually sell wads of fake bills that you can count after the stroke of midnight.</li>
		</ul></p>
		<h3><a id="Day_4_Jan_1st_2017_Stomach_problems_63"></a>Day 4 (Jan. 1st 2017): Stomach problems</h3>
		<p>Even though we have been super careful with our food &amp; drinks, most people in our crew aren’t feeling well today. Damien, Justine and Ross are feeling especially bad.</p>
		<p>We call Andres’ dad, Guillermo, to the rescue: he’s a gastro-enterologist. He sees everyone, gives us some advice on what to eat and what to avoid, and gives some of us the medication we need to travel the next day.</p>
		<p>From this point forward, we are used to asking each other how we are feeling every day, and talking about poop becomes normal.</p>
		<p>We rest most of the day, and pack our bags for the 8-day tour that starts the next day… We’ll be back in La Paz mid-way through the tour, so we leave what we won’t need with Andrés’ family.</p>
